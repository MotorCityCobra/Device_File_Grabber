# Device_File_Grabber
Notebook (for educational/ skill showcasing purposes only) scrapes movie titles of certain scores and gets torrents.
The other grabs media files from deep in your disorganized media files folder randomly in an amount you specify
Look at the available space on your iPad or whatever device and enter that amount in MB for this script to grab

# Usage  
-i is the path  
-s is the total size of all the files you are moving in GB  
$Python3 demo.py -i '/PATH/TO/YOUR/LARGE/UNSORTED/MEDIA/FOLDER/' -s 50

You will then be promted,  
Would you like to move... 
1. Videos 
2. Music 
3. Photos
Enter a number 1, 2, or 3:

If you don't enter 1, 2, or 3 you will get an error.

After it moves your files you will find them in a directory called '! wish' for you to drag into your device

[I don't practice or condone piracy. Just an easy example of scraping, parsing, and using data.]
